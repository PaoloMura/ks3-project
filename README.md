# KS3 Project

This repository contains resources designed for coding clubs at secondary schools in Bristol.
There are three sets of resources: Sketch, Pygame and Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS).
Sketch and Pygame each includes a set of six worksheets for students to follow during the term.

The **Sketch** resource provides a Python module called `sketch.py`.
This is a wrapper for Pygame that exposes a very small set of functionality.
With it, students can draw shapes onto a window using a simple interface.
Each worksheet takes the student through creating an image using these commands.

The **Pygame** resource teaches the fundamentals of Python programming and the Pygame syntax.
By the end of the worksheets, students should have enough knowledge to create their own games with Pygame.
Unlike Sketch, each worksheet teaches some new concepts while asking the student to modify some given starter code.

The **RPS** resource contains a brief overview for coding a rock-paper-scissors game in Python.
