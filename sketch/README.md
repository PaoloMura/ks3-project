The **sketch.py** module is a simple wrapper for Pygame.
It provides a Window class with methods for drawing shapes on the screen.

The **examples** folder contains demonstrations of simple images created using the sketch module.

The **worksheets** folder contains markdown files of the worksheets for lessons 1 to 6.
They are intended to be used in conjunction with sketch.py and cheat_sheet.md.

It's assumed that students already have an understanding of the following Python concepts:
1. Variables, constants, declaration and assignment
2. Input and output
3. Type casting
4. 1D arrays
5. Random number generation 
6. Selection with IF 
7. Iteration with FOR
8. 2D arrays

The difficulty level of worksheets increases from lessons 1 to 6, with topics such as 2D arrays only being used in the final worksheets.
